# Section Introduction

* You are going to make several models. 
* We’ll be making both high poly and low poly versions of out assets.
* We will emphasise how critical naming is when working with a larger project like this.
* You will be able to create your own mapping, with these we can make the illusion of detail.
* We’ll be constantly checking our model externally
* This will be focused mainly on an interior environment.

# Section Specification

* Create assets to be exported straight into an external program, like a game engine.
* Creating our own textures, and other maps from high detail models and apply them to a low poly version.
* Only modelling the interior of the Gothic Church.

* You can use this technique within Blender itself too for optimisation. 
* I am going to be testing my model externally as I go. I will use Unity to do this.

* I will be keeping my scene simple, primarily for teaching purposes! 
* I encourage you to add more detail, experiment and have fun. Wouldn’t the scene look much more interesting with a chess set in it…

# Planning Your Project
* Plan your project, define it’s scope and your goals- important to prevent scope slip!
* Gather your reference material, if possible explore real world locations to get a feeling. Scour the web for images for you references too.

# Walking And Flying Around The Model
* See how our scene looks and feels walking around it. Using the Fly / Walk Mode.
* Show you how to see the scene in Unity.
* Understand I am using Unity to keep the iterations quick and simple at this early stage.

* Anything external to Blender, you can watch to see how it works and is coming across.
* Better understanding of external programs.
* Join in, if you have Unity installed and are interested in learning more about this prototyping method.

# Light Portals
* Learn how to use light portals.
* Understand the limitations of their use.
* See that they dramatically increase quality and are especially useful for indoor environments.
* They aren’t used externally to Blender.
